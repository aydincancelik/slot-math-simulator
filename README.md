# ðŸŽ° Slot Machine RTP Simulator

A simple yet powerful simulation of a 5-reel slot machine to analyze Return to Player (RTP) over 1 million spins. This project models basic slot mechanics, symbol matching, and evaluates RTP fairness using randomized outcomes.

- Simulates 1,000,000 spins on a 5-symbol slot machine
- Randomly chooses symbols per reel (A, K, Q, J, 10, BONUS)
- Pays out based on exact matches across all 5 reels
- Calculates and prints the final RTP (Return to Player)

## ðŸ”¢ Payout Table

| BONUS  | 20     |
| A      | 10     |
